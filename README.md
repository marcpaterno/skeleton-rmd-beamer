# Fermilab-themed Beamer talk from Rmarkdown

This is a skeleton (actually, a short sample) talk using a Fermilab theme, and 
generated from Rmarkdown using the LaTeX package `beamer`.

To build, it relies on having the `ssddoc` package available, and found through
the `SSDDOC_INC` environment variable.
